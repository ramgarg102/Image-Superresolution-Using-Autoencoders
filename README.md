# Image-Superresolution
The aim of this project is to enhance the image quality of distorted or low quality images using Auto-encoders.

Here, the LFW dataset is used with contains around 13000 images of various people. The quality of the images is reduced to 1/4th of the original quality and fed into the model. The expected output should be the original images. The model learns to create the actual image. This acts as self supervised learning
