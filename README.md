# Image-Superresolution
Built a deep learning model that enhances the image quality of distorted or low quality images using Convolutional Neural Networks and Auto-encoders.

Here, the LFW dataset is used with contains around 13000 images of various people. The quality of the images of people is reduced to 1/4th of the original quality and fed into the model.

The model learns to create the actual image from the distorted image acting like self-supervised learning. It provides images with far better quality than the distorted images.
